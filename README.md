# Digital Convolution
A common operation in scientific computing is digital convolution, by which each element in a multi-dimensional grid is replaced by a weighted sum of its neighbors. This has applications in graphics, in which such operations are done to both blur and sharpen images, and in numerical simulations, in which this may be a single step in a Poisson solver.
# OpenMPI
OpenMPI is a popular implementation of a message passing interface, here used on TACC to increase performance of our digital convolution algorithm.
